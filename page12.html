            Electro is cocooned in webbing, helpless! Despite his struggles and invective, he won’t be
            breaking out of that any time soon. Still, why is he grinning? You wonder as you approach.
            The grin gets wider as suddenly the building’s alarm system goes off! “I’ve been using my
            powers to keep the electricity in the alarm system from flowing. I just let it go.” Electro’s
            voice is muffled by the strands of webbing across his face, but you can get the gist of what
            he has to say. “When the cops get here, I’m going to tell them that you’re my accomplice.
            The guy who hired me for this gig will bail me out. You, on the other hand, may not be so
            lucky!” His mocking laughter echoes through the darkened lobby.
