            As you come around the corner by the bank Manager’s office, you are assaulted by the
            smell of ozone. Your old foe Electro is standing in front of the huge circular door of the
            bank’s vault! The lock looks half-melted, and a puddle of slagged metal is cooling on the
            marble tile at its base. “Spider-man! You’re early – you usually don’t put in an appearance
            until the alarms go off!“ Electricity arcs between his hands and his teeth are bared in a sav-
            age grin. “It’s just as well, Spider-clown; I was getting bored with melting locks anyway!”
