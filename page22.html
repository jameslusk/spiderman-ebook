            You swing up onto the roof, ahead of where Electro is flying. “So, smart guy – who pays
            somebody to rob a bank? Even you can come up with a better story than that!” If I can get
            him talking, he might tell me what’s really going on here...<br><br>
            
            “A guy with a flattop and lousy taste in cigars hired me – but not to commit robbery.” Electro
            smirks. “That somebody you know?”<br><br>
            Yeah, somebody I know, all right – J. Jonah Jameson! I never figured J.J.J. would stoop this
            low...<br><br>
            “This was never about the money in the vault, web-head — I was hired to frame you for bank robbery!”
            Electro is done talking, and gets ready to fight! Go to P25.
