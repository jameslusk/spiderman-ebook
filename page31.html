            Electro spills the beans – all of them: “J. J. Jameson, your favorite newspaper publisher, hired
            me to do a frame-up job on you. I wasn’t supposed to actually rob the bank, just get you in-
            side and get you caught by the cops. Heh. Just between us, if that didn’t work out, I was
            planning on cracking that vault anyway, just to cover my expenses.” Electro will smirk slight-
            ly. “I’d keep an eye out behind me if I was you – Jameson seemed kind of... obsessed. He
            wants you behind bars. Just because I couldn’t make it happen, doesn’t mean that he won’t
            try hiring somebody else.”<br><br>
            On that note, you and Electro part ways, warily trusting one another – at least until you’re
            each out of one another’s sight.<br><br>
            Congratulations! You foiled a crime, and in the process discovered that your most dangerous
            foe might not be some costumed supervillain; it might just be your own boss at the Daily Bu-
            gle, J. Jonah Jameson!<br><br>
            But what will this discovery mean for the future of the amazing Spider-man?
