            The alarm klaxons and flashing lights tell you that you don’t have much time. Still, you grab
            a marker and a sticky-note from the Manager’s desk and leave a note stuck to the webbing
            over Electro’s mouth. ‘To New York’s Finest, from your friendly neighborhood Spider-man!’
            You snap a couple of quick photos to sell to the Bugle, for good measure.
            Maybe the note will give the NYPD a reason to doubt Electro’s story. Or, more likely, it’ll
            just cheese someone off because I’m bragging that I caught him before they did. Heaving a
            sigh, you turn and sprint down the employee hallway.<br><br>
            Congratulations! You captured Electro! That’s a victory, even if he does manage to implicate you in his crime. 
            J. Jonah Jameson will get another furious editorial out of it, smearing
            your reputation – but that’s nothing new. And if Electro does make bail, you can count on
            his not going straight. Sooner or later, Spider-man will get a rematch!
