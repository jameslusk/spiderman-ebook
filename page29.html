            Trying to get Electro to tell you more might be tough. You use your spider agility to pounce onto his back, 
            but he sends a shockwave through your spine that would like up a hundred Christmas trees.
            As you stand up you realize he is throwing a electro-charged punch your way! You quickly dodge, slide underneath
            his arm and wrap him in webs from behind. Electro bellows out, “This was never about the
            money in the vault, web-head — I was hired to pin attempted bank robbery on you. There
            was even a bonus if the cops took you away in cuffs!”
