            Electro’s last blast felt like stepping on the third rail – the world went white, then the
            world went away. It comes back along with a pounding headache, muscle cramps, and a
            blazing bright light against your eyelids. Groggily, you raise your head. Wow, its morning...
            aaand I’m on a rooftop. What the... Where’d the bank go? You look around. Looks like
            Brooklyn. How’d I get to Brooklyn?
            Then you spot the note, written on Excelsior
            Bank and Trust stationery. ‘Good morning, Spi-
            der-jerk. If it’s daylight, you’d better find some-
            place to hide, because you’re a wanted man.
            When we left the bank, I set off the alarms. I’m
            sure the cops will see all the webbing you left
            behind, and draw the right conclusions. There’s
            a trail of money from the vault leading toward
            you, too. The man who hired me to pin this on
            you offered a bonus if the cops actually bring
            you in, so I’ll write the cash off as a good investment. 
            Maybe they’ll give you my old cell at Rykers. E.’
            Well, that could have gone better. This might be a good time for Spider-man to get in
            touch with friends in the hero community, and start trying to figure a way out of this mess!
